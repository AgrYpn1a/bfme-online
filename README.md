First of all, make sure that the upgrade ID = `{72F89831-0DFB-4C36-8F65-2AEB43D90DFE}`. This ID will be used for the first release, and so must be used when building any other releases.

### Building new version

### Debugging guide
Because the application consists of multiple windows (window forms) it is useful to be able to run these windows isolated. For this purpose we define pre-processor variables that help setup particular windows to launch separately. Following processor variables can be defined:
- `DEBUG_MAIN_WIN` - to setup a main window.
- `DEBUG_OPTIONS_WIN` - to setup options.ini editor window.
